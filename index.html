                <h1>History<br></h1>
                <p>Dance is a large part of my life. When I was about 3-4 years old, My mother put me into the first steps program in The Ailey School. Since then, I have been training with Alvin Ailey and I am currently in their junior division program
                    in Level 5. For the past 4 summers, I have been dancing with the Joffrey and Ailey schools. These two schools are very different experiences. Each of them have their own history and feel one must experience to understand. I have been
                    accepted into several programs such as the Joffrey trainee program, Earl Mosley's institute of the Arts summer intensive, and many other Joffrey summer programs such as their ballet program and their pre-professional program. I have
                    also gotten a partial scholarship into the Joffrey jazz and contemporary program. I also received a full scholarship Alvin Ailey professional division program which I am most proud about. Dancing is my passion and I hope to make something out of it when I get older.
                    <br></p>

                           <p>The Ailey School is where it all began for me with my lifetime of dancing. Ailey is such a big part of my life and i would not be the same without it. I started off in First Steps, a program for children in the Ailey School. In this level red leotards were worn. Then as I got older, I moved into the Junior Division. This division is divided into about 6 different levels with many different groups inside the levels. I am currently in level 5, the second highest level. Level placement is based on age and as you get older, skill. Each level has their own distinct leotard color, mine is burgundy. It is the same for the Junior Division in the summer intensive except, the levels are letters, not numbers. The summer is a bit more competetive then fall term because of the diversity in the summer. People come from all over the world with many different skills. Proffesional Division is quite the same, which I will be doing the summer intensive for. Ailey has given me a family, a home, and a passion. Words cannot express my love for the Alvin Ailey School. </p>

                            <p> The Ailey Extension is a program that gives back to the people. It is such an amazing way to try dance classes if you're a beginner or just take a class for a warm-up before a show or to get started with your day. Having classes available, especially for a small cost, is such an essential for a dancer. This keeps dancers in shape as well as allows the public to see and feel what it is like first hand to be a dancer. You do not need any prior technique or knowledge of dance to take these classes.</p>

                            <p>The Joffrey Summer Insensive is an intense one. Although my experience was not as I had hoped it would have been, I still go back to audition for Joffrey. The Joffrey School has something about it that just pulls you in. Joffrey is very competetive, which adds on to a dancer's discipline. What I mean by this is, because you have greater competition, you strive to acheive much more than you originally set yourself to. This adds to your discipline by making you a stronger and more suitable competitor for dance. At the end of the day, the Joffrey family is quite welcoming and opportunisic when it comes to making a proffesional dancer. </p>

                    <h1><i>Determination</i></h1>
                    <p> Dancers will do anything to get where we need to go to succeed and be “satisfied”. They are determined people. We are people who never give up. There is no such thing as perfect in our vocabulary. There’s always room for improvement.
                        We always want to better ourselves to be the best. Dancers are disciplined to do such.

                <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                    <h1><i>Strength</i></h1>
                    <p> Dancers are one of the strongest athletes there are and yes, we are athletes. Dancers do twice as much as any other athlete. We condition, have a class to a few classes, stretch, rehearsal, and a show all in one day. When it’s performance
                        season, sometimes 6 days out of the week. A lot of dancers have a 10 hour day and there is never an off season. Dancers are always dancing no matter what.

                    <h1><i>Emotion</i></h1>
                    <p>Dancers are emotional wrecks, the stereotype is true. When audition season comes around, tensions rise, friendships end, the focus is all to dance. We all want to get a lead role or just be in the dance in general. Auditions are stressful
                        and it can be even more stressful when you want it so bad but you did not get the part. It makes us feel like we are not good enough.

                    <h1><i>Family</i></h1>
                    <p>Dance is what you make of it. Depending on your enviornment, you create a family. Dancers connect with eachother in a way no ordinary person would understand. Dancers understand the struggle and what we are fighting for. No matter
                        how bloody, nasty, violent, cruel, or devious things may get, there is plenty of love to go around for people who have the same common intrest as you.</p>
